# Web-based video browser

This video browser uses the YouTube API to fetch data and show real YouTube videos on screen. Videos can be searched, selected, and played in a similar way to how you would normally do so on YouTube. 

This app was part of an online React course I am currently taking on Udemy. As my familiarity with React grows, I may or may not be adding my own extra functionalities to it.

### To run: 
- Clone repo and cd to project directory
- npm install
- npm run start
- 'localhost:8081' on the browser
